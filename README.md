## Summary and Closing statement
This code is highly reusable as it only requires a change in the dependances and that the dependances meet the same requirements as the one use in this code. So it can be easily copied into a folder with a diferent CSV file and read that one as it read the previous. For examole, lets say you wanted to audit 20 instead of 3 counties, well the code allows for you do add as many counties as you wish because it doesn't delimit them to only a few. Secondly if your rows changed, then if you go to where we set the rows values, you can simply change them to the approrite position and the rest of the code will run through it. However the current limit would be that we can only go via majority vote, if another state for example used something more similar to the electoral college than the way we proccess the data will have to change.
